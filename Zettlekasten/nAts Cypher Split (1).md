# Notes

## Attack
* Pistol 
	* A start (If team does not cancel push, stay with them anyway)
* Lurking
	* Fake lurk A with A ramp and main cages + cam when OP is holding from ramp

____
## Defense
* Pistol
	- Start A, jump cam to check early presence, if none then rotate mid (also change trip to extended)
		- Rotate if team is flanking from A instead of you
* Bonus
	* If nothing on cam, group up with team
* Eco
	* Do same jump cam and trips, play site on pressure
* Don't be afraid to use cage to push through to kill lurker
* If you expect heavy A, play screens with jett/raze jump trip
