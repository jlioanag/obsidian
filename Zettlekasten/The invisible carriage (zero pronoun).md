# The invisible carriage

We don't need an "it" in a sentence for communicative purposes.
> "The ball fell down. It rolled down the hill" vs. "The ball fell down. Rolled down the hill."
> "I got really hungry" vs. "Got really hungry"]

In Japanese pronouns can be replaced by the "zero pronoun."
The **Engine** is always visible.
