# A is B and A does B
All sentences have a *Main Car (A)* and *Engine (B)*. This is the core.

In any language there are only two kinds of sentences.
#### A does B
(A) さくら　**が**　(B)歩く
> が is the link between A and B
#### A is B
さくらが日本人**だ**
> だ is a "one-way equals sign" so, Sakura is a Japanese person, but not all Japanese people are Sakura.
> Note: だ is a more simple version of です
