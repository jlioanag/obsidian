## Background context
Light roast blooms less than dark roasts (less CO2)
The warmer you keep coffee the faster it will "de-gas"
## Why we rest coffee
#### Filter coffee 
Usually wait only 3-5 days
Light roasts may be better for longer like 10 days
#### Espresso
Should wait for 10 days to de-gas the large quantity CO2
